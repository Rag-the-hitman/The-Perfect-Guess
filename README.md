# The-Perfect-Guess
**What's The Prefect Game**
The Perfect Guess is a simple game (beginner-friendly) code in python language.
In this game, the computer will guess a random number and you have to guess the number.
The number of your guesses will be stored in the result.txt file and the high score will also be stored in highscore.txt.

**Make sure it works for you as well**
1. In line no. 20 change the "F:\\The Perfect Guess\\result.txt" to desired location of your result.txt.
2. Same goes for line 23 and 28.
